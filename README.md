# Hi, I'm Liz!
I’m a Computer Science junior at Binghamton University. Here are some cool projects I’ve made.

## Video Games
### Curious Cats [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
A 2D puzzle game me and a partner created in Unity with C#. 
<br/>It houses original pixel art assets and was made within a month for the GameOff 2022 game jam!
<br/>My role was the artist and UI programmer. I created all sprites and animations and integrated them into the code properly. I designed the UI, created all sprites for UI elements, and ensured that the interface was easy and satisfying to use. I'm really happy with how it turned out, from the custom cursor to the bouncy buttons!

#### Little Trouble [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
This is a small platformer video game me and a partner created in Unity (in C#). 
<br/>It is a 2D metroidvania with original pixel art assets made within a month for the GameOff 2021 game jam.
<br/> I personally was the project lead and asset developer. I organized responsibilities, set up deadlines, designed ability flavors (i.e. the double jump being a pair of maple tree seeds), designed UI, and created *all* art assets.

 *Might need to zoom out in the browser and then make the game full-screen to see all UI elements.

#### I Can't Believe It's Not Breakout [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
A small game in Unity that furthered my knowledge on scenes, object spawning, and event management.
<br/> The blocks spawn with a chance of providing an effect: giving +1 ball to the player (orange), freezing the paddle (blue), or speeding up all balls x2 (yellow).
<br/> (This is a very original game not at all related to *Breakout* by Atari.)

#### Definitely Not Asteroids [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
The very first game I made in Unity, the game is not pretty but taught me a lot of important things.
<br/> Oh, and it's *not* at all similar to *Asteroids* by Atari, I have no idea what you're talking about ...

## Applications
#### Rock Climbing Site [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
For my 2022 summer internship, me and 2 other interns had to develop a simple application within 2 weeks based on a user story. A big focus was proper communication with its database.
<br/> Our application has three roles: Climber, Guide, and Administrator. Climbers can view routes across the U.S. and request a guide to take them through that route. Guides approve or reject requests and can add new routes to the database. Admins approve additions and have a dashboard with various reports.
<br/> I personally worked a lot on the 'Climber requests a Guide' aspect, as well as making sure the user experience and UI was at its best.

## Data Structures
#### Sports Player Manager [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
As part of my Data Structures course, I had to create custom C++ classes that used *only* dynamic storage (i.e. no arrays or vectors) to create and manage a League of Teams, each of which had unique Players. The program needed to have zero memory leaks.
[See more here.](Player%20Manager/)

#### Integer Set [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
Created for my Computer Architecure II class, the set for integers was made in C with a focus on proper pointer and memory management. The set was implemented using a linked list and had these requirements: no duplicate items, can add an array of ints to the set, can create a union of two sets, can create an intersection of two sets.
[See more.](Integer%20Set/)

## Computer Architecture
#### Cache Simulator [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
For my Computer Architecture II class, I created a simulation for a simple cache in C. Given a memory address, the program masks out bits that specify which line of which set to look in. The simulation returns a hit, miss with no replacement, and miss with replacement; if a replacement is necessary, the code allows for a least-recently-used, most-recently-used, and random replacement strategy. The program had to have no memory leaks.

## Written Work
#### Research Report [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
For my first three semesters at Binghamton University I was part of the program First-Year Research Immersion. The goal was to provide an introduction to research, for CS students that being specifically on machine learning.
<br/> Me and 3 peers worked on the project *Integrating Deep Q-Learning with Learning from Demonstration to Solve Atari Games*, which essentially combined two types of machine learning methods to have a computer play Atari's *Breakout*.
<br/> At the end of the program, I had to write a 5,000 word research report on our project and findings. [You can read the full report here on GitHub.](/Written%20Work/Research%20Report.pdf) <br/>

<br/> P.S. We also presented our project in the annual FRI Poster Session.

#### Google DeepMind vs. IBM Watson for Oncology [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
For one of my university courses, I had to compare two algorithms and their impact on society. I chose to compare DeepMind's and IBM Watson's algorithms for identifying breast cancer.
