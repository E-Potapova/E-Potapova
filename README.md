## Video Games
### Little Trouble [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
This is a small platformer video game created in Unity (in C#). It is a 2D metroidvania with original pixel art assets made within a month for the GameOff 2021 game jam.
<br/> *screenshots + video here*
<br/>[Play the game right now!](https://e-potapova.itch.io/little-trouble) 
<br/> *Might need to zoom out in the browser and then make the game full-screen to see all UI elements.
