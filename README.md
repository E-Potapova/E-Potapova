# Hi, I'm Liz!
I’m a Computer Science junior at Binghamton University. Here are some cool projects I’ve made.

## Video Games
### Little Trouble [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
This is a small platformer video game me and a partner created in Unity (in C#). 
<br/>It is a 2D metroidvania with original pixel art assets made within a month for the GameOff 2021 game jam.
<br/> I personally was the project lead and asset developer. I organized responsibilities, set up deadlines, designed ability flavors (i.e. the double jump being a pair of maple tree seeds), designed UI, and created *all* art assets.

<br/> *Might need to zoom out in the browser and then make the game full-screen to see all UI elements.

### I Can't Believe It's Not Breakout [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
A small game in Unity that furthered my knowledge on scenes, object spawning, and event management.
<br/> The blocks spawn with a chance of providing an effect: giving +1 ball to the player (orange), freezing the paddle (blue), or speeding up all balls x2 (yellow).
<br/> (This is a very original game not at all related to *Breakout* by Atari.)

### Definitely Not Asteroids [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
The very first game I made in Unity, the game is not pretty but taught me a lot of important things.
<br/> Oh, and it's *not* at all similar to *Asteroids* by Atari, I have no idea what you're talking about ...

## Applications
### Rock Climbing Site [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
For my 2022 summer internship, me and 2 other interns had to develop a simple application within 2 weeks based on a user story. A big focus was proper communication with its database.
<br/> Our application has three roles: Climber, Guide, and Administrator. Climbers can view routes across the U.S. and request a guide to take them through that route. Guides approve or reject requests and can add new routes to the database. Admins approve additions and have a dashboard with various reports.
<br/> I personally worked a lot on the 'Climber requests a Guide' aspect, as well as making sure the user experience and UI was at its best.

## Data Structures
### Sports Player Manager [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
As part of my Data Structures course, I had to create custom C++ classes that used *only* dynamic storage (i.e. no arrays or vectors) to create and manage a League of Teams, each of which had unique Players. The program needed to have zero memory leaks.

### Integer Set [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
Created for my Computer Architecure II class, the set for integers was made in C with a focus on proper pointer and memory management. The set was implemented using a linked list and had these requirements: no duplicate items, can add an array of ints to the set, can create a union of two sets, can create an intersection of two sets.

## Computer Architecture
### Cache Simulator [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
For my Computer Architecture II class, I created a simulation for a simple cache in C. Given a memory address, the program masks out bits that specify which line of which set to look in. The simulation returns a hit, miss with no replacement, and miss with replacement; if a replacement is necessary, the code allows for a least-recently-used, most-recently-used, and random replacement strategy. The program had to have no memory leaks.

## Written Work
### Research Report [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
For my first three semesters at Binghamton University I was part of the program First-Year Research Immersion. The goal was to provide an introduction to research, for CS students that being specifically on machine learning.
<br/> Me and 3 peers worked on the project *Integrating Deep Q-Learning with Learning from Demonstration to Solve Atari Games*, which essentially combined two types of machine learning methods to have a computer play Atari's *Breakout*.
<br/> At the end of the program, I had to write a 5,000 word research report on our project and findings. [You can read the full report here on GitHub.](/Written%20Work/Research%20Report.pdf) <br/>
[Alternate: View full report in Google PDF viewer (might need to click 5 times)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/E-Potapova/E-Potapova/raw/main/Written%20Work/Research%20Report.pdf)
<br/> P.S. We also presented our project in the annual FRI Poster Session.

### Google DeepMind vs. IBM Watson for Oncology [:top:](#hi-im-liz)
For one of my university courses, I had to compare two algorithms and their impact on society. I chose to compare DeepMind's and IBM Watson's algorithms for identifying breast cancer.
